# Scheme Interpreter

This is a Scheme interpreter, written in Chez Scheme. It is an exercise of ideas from the [wizard book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), and [William Byrd](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSC9kYeTee012BRsYw-y12Q)'s hangout series on youtube.

The idea is to implement an environment passing interpreter, with lexical scope. I'm adding the ideas from the book as I go.
